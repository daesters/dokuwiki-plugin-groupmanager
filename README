GROUPMANAGER
========

GROUPMANAGER is a simple group manager plugin for dokuwiki.
It is based on the original plugin _groupmgr_ by Alex Forencich.
The original plugin has not been updated since 2010.
It actually even never left the devel-zone, but the idea is great!

GROUPMGR allowed easy modification of group membership by non-admins.
This greatly simplifies management of collaborative projects by group-admins.
GROUPMANAGER adds functionality from the USERMANAGER by Christopher Smith to the original code of Alex Forencich.
This way users can easily be found and added in wikis with many users.
Also GROUPMANAGER can be configured to add or delete users altogether if they are no member of a group.

Installation
------------

Unzip into lib/plugins directory

SYNTAX
------
~~GROUPMANAGER|[groups to manage]|[allowed users and groups]~~
Groups to manage separated by commas; the first group in the list will be the default group.

EXAMPLE 1
---------
~~GROUPMANAGER|wg_mygroup_reader|@wg_mygroup_admin~~

Members of group ‘ wg_mygroup_reader ‘ can be managed by group ‘ wg_mygroup_admin ‘

EXAMPLE 2
---------
~~GROUPMANAGER|wg_mygroup_reader, wg_mygroup_editor|harald, @admin~~

Members of ‘ wg_mygroup_reader ‘ and ‘ wg_mygroup_editor ‘ can be managed by user ‘harald’
and members of the group ‘admin’

Remarks
   1.	In the examples above groups managed by groupmanager are named following the naming 
		convention “wg_[groupname]_[role]”. This is not required by the syntax, but I would
		advise it nevertheless. (Side note: The interface beautifies the name of groups for
		simple users a bit by deleting the prefix “wg_”, replacing “_” with ” ” and
		capitalizing the first letter of the resulting words.)
	2.	Super user groups can only be managed by super users
	3.	Group-admins may assign the group-admin role to other users!
	4.	But: users cannot remove themselves from the group that grants them access to the
		group admin (including admins)
	5.	The conf_namespace option specifies a separate namespace for configuration.
		When the config namespace is used, a placeholder tag (~~groupmanager~~) can be used
		in the actual page while the full tag is placed in the configuration namespace at
		config_namespace:ID. 
	6.	If require_conf_namespace is set, all configuration options placed in the page
		are ignored, necessitating the use of the configuration namespace. For security
		reasons, this is the default configuration.
	7.	The “forbidden_groups” configuration setting specifies groups that cannot be
		edited with the plugin (only relevant if conf_namespace is not configured).
	8.	If allow_add_user is set, a dialog will be present in the interface that will
		allow users to be added to the Wiki. They will be automatically added to the
		“default” group, which is the first managed group (wg_mygroup_reader in the example).
	9.	If allow_delete_user is set, checkboxes will be added to each user-record.
		Clicking on “update group” will delete checked users.
